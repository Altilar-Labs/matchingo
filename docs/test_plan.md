# Matchingo Test Plan: Core Engine & Order Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the core functionalities of the Matchingo order book system. The focus is on the matching engine logic, handling of different order types, order book management, and the integrity of execution reporting via Kafka.

## 2. Objectives

*   Verify the correctness of the price-time priority matching algorithm.
*   Ensure accurate processing and state management for all supported order types (Market, Limit, Stop-Limit) and Time-in-Force options (GTC, IOC, FOK).
*   Validate the lifecycle management of orders and order books (creation, cancellation, retrieval, deletion).
*   Confirm that accurate and complete execution reports (`DoneMessage`) are published to the configured Kafka topic.
*   Prevent regressions in core functionality as new features are added or changes are made.
*   Ensure robustness and correct error handling for invalid inputs or states.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

*   Core matching logic (price-time priority).
*   Processing of Limit, Market, and Stop-Limit orders.
*   Handling of GTC, IOC, and FOK Time-in-Force options.
*   Order book state management and retrieval.
*   Order creation, cancellation, and retrieval.
*   Partial and full order fills.
*   Execution report generation and publishing to Kafka.
*   Basic error handling for invalid operations.
*   Functionality with both Memory and Redis backends.

### Out of Scope (for this plan)

*   Detailed performance/load testing (covered separately).
*   UI/Client application testing beyond basic command execution.
*   Infrastructure testing (Kafka cluster health, Redis scaling, etc.).
*   Security testing.
*   Specific downstream consumer logic for Kafka messages.

## 4. Key Testing Areas & Scenarios

### 4.1. Matching Engine Core Logic

| Scenario ID | Description                                                                 | Expected Result                                                                                                | Coverage                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ME-001      | **Price Priority (Buy)**: Buy limit order matches lowest ask price first.     | Order matches against the lowest price ask level available.                                                    | `orderbook_test.go:TestPriceTimePriority`, `orderbook_test.go:TestMultiLevelMatching` (implicit), `integration_v2_test.go:TestIntegrationV2_MarketOrderMatch` (implicit) |
| ME-002      | **Price Priority (Sell)**: Sell limit order matches highest bid price first.  | Order matches against the highest price bid level available.                                                   | `orderbook_test.go:TestPriceTimePriority` (implicit), `orderbook_test.go:TestMultiLevelMatching` (implicit)                                                              |
| ME-003      | **Time Priority**: Orders at the same price level match based on FIFO.        | Older order at a price level is filled before newer orders at the same level.                                  | `orderbook_test.go:TestPriceTimePriority`                                                                                                                               |
| ME-004      | **Basic Match (Full Fill)**: Taker limit order fully fills a single maker order. | Both orders are removed from the book. Correct `DoneMessage` published for both taker and maker.                | `orderbook_test.go:TestCompleteOrderExecution` (covers concept), `integration_v2_test.go:TestIntegrationV2_IOC_FOK/FOK_Success`                                          |
| ME-005      | **Basic Match (Partial Fill - Taker)**: Taker limit order partially fills a maker order. | Maker order quantity is reduced. Taker order is fully filled. Correct `DoneMessage` published.           | `orderbook_test.go:TestLimitOrderMatching`, `integration_v2_test.go:TestIntegrationV2_LimitOrderMatch`                                                                   |
| ME-006      | **Basic Match (Partial Fill - Maker)**: Taker limit order is larger than the maker order. | Maker order is fully filled and removed. Taker order quantity is reduced and remains/matches further. Correct `DoneMessage`. | `orderbook_test.go:TestMarketOrderExecution`, `orderbook_test.go:TestLimitOrderMatching`, `integration_v2_test.go:TestIntegrationV2_LimitOrderMatch`                    |
| ME-007      | **Multi-Level Match**: Taker order consumes liquidity across multiple price levels. | Order matches sequentially against orders at improving price levels until filled or liquidity exhausted. Correct `DoneMessage`. | `orderbook_test.go:TestMultiLevelMatching`                                                                                                                               |
| ME-008      | **Self-Matching Prevention**: Attempt to submit an order that would match an existing order from the same user/source (if identifiable) or under specific conditions. | The system should prevent or handle self-matching according to defined rules (e.g., reject, cancel both). *Requires clarification on self-matching rules.* | N/A (Rules TBD)                                                                                                                                                     |

## 5. Test Execution Strategy

*   **Manual Testing**: Use the `orderbook-client` CLI to execute scenarios defined above against a locally running server. Verify outputs and Kafka messages (using a Kafka consumer tool).
*   **Automated Testing**: Develop unit tests (`pkg/core`, `pkg/server`) and integration tests that cover these scenarios programmatically. Leverage existing test files (`_test.go`) and add new ones as needed.
*   **Backend Variation**: Key scenarios (especially those involving state) should be tested with both `memory` and `redis` backends.

## 6. Tools

*   `orderbook-server`: The gRPC server binary.
*   `orderbook-client`: The gRPC client CLI binary.
*   Go testing framework (`go test`).
*   Kafka Consumer Tool (e.g., `kcat`, custom Go consumer) to inspect messages.
*   Redis client (`redis-cli`) to inspect state for Redis backend tests (optional).
